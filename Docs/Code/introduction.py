    '''Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
    Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
    Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
    including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
    It is often described as a 'batteries included' language due to its comprehensive standard 
    library."
